The concept of employing ensembles of specialized neural networks, opportunistically used individually or in combination for task-specific computations, has garnered considerable attention in recent years. The technical details of this approach have been extensively discussed, from seminal work~\cite{jacobs1991adaptive, jordan1994hierarchical} to state-of-the-art research~\cite{jiang2024mixtral, deepseek2024v2, dai2024deepseekmoe}. We have arranged previous efforts in this direction into three categories: (\textbf{1}) expert prediction, \textbf{(2)} expert orchestration, and \textbf{(3)} expert usage characterization. 

\noindent\textbf{Expert Prediction:}
Prior work on expert prediction has evolved from reactive routing to proactive prediction strategies. Speculative MoE~\cite{li2025speculative} and DAOP~\cite{zhang2025daop} present us with frameworks that predict the next expert before routing decisions are made, reaping benefits through a speculative execution strategy along the prediction hint. Cross-layer approaches~\cite{chen2025crosslayer} and task-aware systems~\cite{wang2025emoe} leverage adjacent layer information to improve prediction accuracy. MoE-GPS~\cite{ma2025moegpsguidlinespredictionstrategy} provides systematic guidelines for predictor selection, while Expert-Token Resonance MoE~\cite{li2025experttokenresonancemoebidirectional} introduces bidirectional selection and collaborative optimization strategies. Recent prediction-based approaches~\cite{liu2024prediction} demonstrate load stabilization through predictive mechanisms. Note however that, unlike Prophet, these predictive strategies do not provide a large-scale, expert-level utilization analysis. By adopting an information-theoretic framework, we reveal distinct patterns of per-expert utilization as a function of batch size, conditions that more closely reflect real-world deployments where the number of experts continues to grow.

\noindent\textbf{Expert Orchestration:}
Research efforts in the direction of orchestration of experts include addressing system-level challenges like housing the memory-intensive expert parameters in multi-tiered memory hierarchies, opportunistically caching the required experts in limited device memory along with minimizing communicational overhead~\cite{li2025comoe,suo2025coserve,kong2025serving,adapmoe}. Advanced caching systems include ProMoE~\cite{promoe}, MoE-Infinity~\cite{moeinfinity}, and HOBBIT~\cite{hobbit}. Distributed training optimizations are explored by FasterMoE~\cite{fastermoe}, Expert Choice Routing~\cite{expertchoice}, and MegaBlocks~\cite{megablocks}, focusing on load balancing and communication efficiency. An often overlooked but critical metric optimized by Prophet is the memory bandwidth and the count of unique experts that can be housed per inference. By combining high predictor accuracy with deduplication, Prophet loads more distinct experts into GPU memory without triggering out-of-memory events, while concomitantly reducing memory-bandwidth contention.

\noindent\textbf{Expert Usage Characterization:}
Prior work in this domain includes exploring the correlation among experts to complement optimization strategies~\cite{lo2025closerlookmixtureofexpertslarge, chen2024layerwise, zhang2024harder, oldfield2024multilinear}. The literature on specialization and redundancy spans DeepSeekMoE~\cite{dai2024deepseekmoe}, which enables fine-grained expert segmentation for behavioral profiling, and MoNE~\cite{zhang2024mone}, which addresses redundancy via a dual-metric assessment. Complementary work on semantic routing~\cite{chen2025probing} and correlation modeling~\cite{wang2024decorrelated} substantiates input-semantic routing and expert de-correlation techniques. In contrast to these primarily analytic approaches, Prophet couples such insights with system-level mechanisms, thereby translating them into actionable policies. Moreover, while correlation-driven studies are often model family-specific, Prophet leverages its context window to capture evolving temporal correlation characteristic of real-world deployments. Finally, an information-theoretic analysis of expert popularity reveals power-law scaling, conferring scalability across deployment regimes, and furnishing principled metrics for quantifying expert participation during inference.
