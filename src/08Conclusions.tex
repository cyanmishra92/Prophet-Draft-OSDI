In this work, we addressed the fundamental memory bandwidth bottleneck that constrains the practical deployment of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. By analyzing expert routing patterns, we revealed an exploitable structure that enables accurate neural prediction of future expert requirements.  Building on these insights, \emph{Prophet} combines prediction, batch-aware optimization, and hierarchical caching to transform MoE inference from reactive to predictive memory management.  Our evaluation demonstrates $1.5\times$--$3.2\times$ performance speedups and $1.5\times$--$15\times$ memory improvements over prefetching systems, all without requiring model modifications.  These results indicate that predictive memory management removes the dominant I/O barrier, making trillion-parameter MoE models viable across a wide range of hardware environments. Looking ahead, the principles underlying \emph{Prophet}—leveraging learned routing patterns and systematic memory hierarchy optimization—hold promise for broader classes of sparse architectures, where scalability and deployment efficiency will be increasingly critical.
