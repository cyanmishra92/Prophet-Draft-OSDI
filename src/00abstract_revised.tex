Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable trillion-parameter language models through sparse activation, but suffer from severe memory bandwidth bottlenecks, where expert loading dominates 78--96\% of the inference time. Current reactive approaches fail to exploit the inherent structure in expert routing patterns, leading to I/O-to-compute ratios of up to $15\times$ that limit practical deployment.

This paper introduces \textit{Prophet}, a neural expert prefetching system that transforms MoE inference through predictive memory management. Prophet employs a lightweight neural predictor to capture cross-layer routing dependencies, combined with batch-aware deduplication and hierarchical caching to optimize expert loading. Operating as a plug-and-play solution without model modifications, Prophet delivers $1.5\times$--$3.2\times$ performance speedups and $1.5\times$--$15\times$ memory improvements over state-of-the-art prefetching across diverse MoE architectures, enabling practical deployment of trillion-parameter models from edge to datacenter environments.
